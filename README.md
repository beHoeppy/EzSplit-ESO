# Easy Split
A small utility for ESO logs created with [EasyStalking-ESO](https://github.com/beHoeppy/EzStalking-ESO).

Easy Split will create a separate log for a complete instance run, or reset, which will make it easy to find the clean trifecta or score run you want to share.

## Usage
* simply drag and drop the *.log file you want to split on ezsplit.exe
* hit return when the ["Jobs done ..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r06heQ5HsI)
* the splits will be found in the directory alongside your *.log file

## Building
$ git clone http://github.com/beHoeppy/EzSplit-ESO
$ cd EzSplit-ESO
